<p>Too many times we have heard young people ask us questions such as "can women be software engineers?" or comments such as "there is no one in tech who looks like me".</p>
<br>
<p>At She Codes we are trying to change that, this website was created as a hub where the community can create profiles of women and non-binary folk. The idea would be that we could share this website to show young people that anyone can work in Tech.</p>
<br>
<p>This website is our our final group project for She Codes Brisbane Cohort 2021 and an example of women giving "Tech" a go! Our group, the Robust-Code-Beans, worked with our client Sara Borgstrom (BHP) to develop a MVP (Minimum Viable Product) website with the product aim above.</p>
<br>
<p>An MVP is the base features and functionality required by the client to meet initial approval. In the "real world" we would then continue to work through improvements and additional features in communication with the client until a final end point is reached.</p>
<br>
<p>We had only a few weeks to complete the MVP while all juggling work, family and other commitments. We did push ourselves to implement functionality that we had not used previously such as image uploding, filters based on multiple criteria, profile approval/decline process and also tried out MUI Library for our navigation. This was our first time working collaboratively using github which was a learning curve but part of the process.</p>
